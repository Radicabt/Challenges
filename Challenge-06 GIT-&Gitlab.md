Challenge-06 GIT - Specification
For this week’s challenge, you will need to work with the GitLab repository
you have created for the previous week’s challenge.
If you still have not finished the challenge, create a new repository, and name it BrainsterChallenges_FirstnameLastnameGroup.
Ex: BrainsterChallenges_AntonioStoimenovFE1.
This challenge’s primary goal is to add all of your previous challenges on different branches, leaving the main branch only with the readme file.
Each of the branches will have the name as the challenge, ex: “Challenge 01 - HTML”, “Challenge 02 - CSS Intro”, etc.
If you do not have completed the previous challenges, leave the branches only with the readme file.
Create an additional branch named “Challenge06 - Git & GitLab”, where you would shortly describe the workflow for finishing all of the tasks for this challenge.
